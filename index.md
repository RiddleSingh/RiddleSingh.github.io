I recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania expected and got my Masters in Electrical Engineering in December 2022. After my masters, I joined Qualcomm CPU Architecture and Performance team and I started to work on something that is quite interesting to me.

In general, I am interested in a wide variety of topics and worked on projects in all these domains - Electronic Hardware Design, Computer Architecture, RFIC, and Photonics. I have three years of professional work experience in an electronics design company where I designed the hardware for rugged electronic devices and for mass manufacturability.

In my experience, I have developed skills in the following areas (Until my Master's):
- Accelerator design using Xilinx VUP9, AWS F1 instance
- SoC Design using Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC
- Electronic circuit analysis, design, and fabrication
- Electronic prototyping platforms (Arduino, ESP, Raspberry Pi, Ultra96, Xilinx VUP9)
- PCB Design and fabrication EDA (Altium Designer, Cadence Allegro) & simulation tools (Keysight ADS, Microwave AWR, Lumerical)
- Programming environments (C++, C, Python, Verilog)
- Test Instruments (Oscilloscope, Spectrum Analyser, Vector Network Analyser)
- Technical writing in design specifics, manuals, test reports, and operational manuals
- Project management and leadership in prolonged projects

Please reach out to me via email if you would like to know more about me and my projects.
